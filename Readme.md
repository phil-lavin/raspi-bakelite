Raspberry Pi Bakelite Phone VoIP Interface Board
================================================

Intro
-----

This repo contains the various bits of code that go to make up the VoIP conversion of a 1950s Bakelite phone using a Raspberry Pi.

The interface between the Raspberry Pi and the phone has been done by means of a custom designed [Pi Hat](https://github.com/raspberrypi/hats).
