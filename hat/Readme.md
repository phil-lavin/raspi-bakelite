Raspberry Pi Bakelite Phone VoIP Interface Board - Hat Designs
=========================================================

## Intro

The Bakelite Interface Board is designed to the functional and [mechanical specifications](https://github.com/raspberrypi/hats/blob/master/hat-board-mechanical.pdf) of a [Pi Hats](https://github.com/raspberrypi/hats).

This directory contains the Eagle cam files (schematic, board and gerbers... and image exports thereof) for the board.

## Schematic

Here is the Eagle schematic for the hat:

The actual Eagle schematic file is also in this directory (the .sch file).

@TODO: Describe it

## Gerbers

The Gerber CAM files which have been built to the Design Rules of [Elecrow](https://www.elecrow.com/pcb-manufacturing.html) are in the gerbers directory.

This is what a rendering of the top and bottom of the board looks like:
